Making the semi-finals of the tournament represents a significant achievement for Dalic’s troops and the coach is keen to seize the moment and take full advantage of the talented crop of technically gifted players available to him.\n\nAfter all, it is not every generation that brings together the likes of Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic, Marcelo Brozovic, Ivan Rakitic and Dejan Lovren, to name but a few, and the prospect of fielding a side boasting such talent clearly strengthens the case of a national team that has made waves at the top table of international football in recent times.\r\n\nTo turn our focus to Qatar, Croatia have been drawn in a difficult Group F, where Modric and company will pit their wits against highly fancied Belgium, of whom, much like the Croatians, big things are expected. Dalic’s charges will also come up against Canada and Morocco, two tough sides who will certainly not make life easy for the Balkan outfit.', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'sections': [], 'contentTypesCheckboxValue': 'Video', 'internalTitle': 'Video > Croatia v England | Semi-finals | 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ | Extended Highlights', 'title': 'Croatia v England | Semi-finals | 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ | Extended Highlights', 'slugV2': 'croatia-v-england-semi-finals-2018-fifa-world-cup-extended-highlights', 'description': 'Watch the extended highlights from the match between Croatia and England played at Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow on Wednesday, 11 July 2018.', 'dateOfReleaseV2': '2018-07-11T00:00:00', 'semanticTags': ['2Gz195Pyz6ljCjBFPPFxht', '7xUlday10PuZVujCcR8iq0', '0x5722578825e577469ec2ec5ed7d592b5', '0x328bf3f28335ab49b08ac829dafa3d12', 'amt4KXUpN75BNvpc0MSKW', '0x117592f1e53eba49ac4c89f6a10f6f6e', '0xfdc0dac12a72ab4b8a22ccddbad12bad', '2a9aS495143EmGghBkztq0', '0x757658c0db60f34a844557a08e92636a', '2X4DCVdND68kLsAaQxX7FT', '0xdfeb6b09584a6344a3ff76c43c22717e'], 'semanticTagReferences': [], 'sys': {'id': 'vu30H5OR9XiSx6AUIu6Rs', 'createdAt': '2022-01-21T12:38:35.734Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-06-06T14:18:04.112Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'video'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia’s Group F fixtures', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Morocco-Croatia', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n23 November, 11:00 (local time)\r\n\n', 'marks': []}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia-Canada', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n27 November, 17:00 (local time)\r\n\n', 'marks': []}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia-Belgium', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n1 December, 16:00 (local time)', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'sections': [], 'contentTypesCheckboxValue': 'Video', 'internalTitle': 'Video > Netherlands v Croatia | Play-off for third place | 1998 FIFA World Cup France™ | Highlights', 'title': 'Netherlands v Croatia | Play-off for third place | 1998 FIFA World Cup France™ | Highlights', 'slugV2': 'netherlands-v-croatia-third-place-match-i-1998-fifa-world-cup-france-highlights', 'description': 'Watch the highlights from the match between Netherlands and Croatia played at Parc des Princes, Paris on Saturday, 11 July 1998.', 'dateOfReleaseV2': '1998-07-11T00:00:00', 'semanticTags': ['2orV3zAQ77fSKVBfqefsDA', '3IFBxv7yOP13m8kLkBAWvE', 'PgRaCY1Y0gLgJEJH6sAYH', '0x3690f1d362555543bfa526aebc3be496', '0x5722578825e577469ec2ec5ed7d592b5', '0x328bf3f28335ab49b08ac829dafa3d12', 'amt4KXUpN75BNvpc0MSKW', '0xd2336894ab243d498aed7b6ddbcc67e1', '0xed2af797aab21e42bc9fb51ff11077a7', '0x705ae90667575b47a70596d95526eb3f', '2X4DCVdND68kLsAaQxX7FT'], 'semanticTagReferences': [], 'sys': {'id': '5EEPlWk5SSwmS2YMGn3GwI', 'createdAt': '2022-01-21T12:34:08.651Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-08-31T14:42:05.966Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'video'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Dalic’s approach and tactics', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'If there is one thing you are guaranteed from Dalic’s team, besides the consistent excellence of the majestic Modric, it is the 4-3-3 formation that has brought such fine results in recent years. The coach’s trusted blueprint has worked a treat and he is sure to retain faith in a system that results in a very attack-minded style of play in which the team look to play in the opposition’s half. Since his appointment as national-team coach, the Livno-born tactician has overseen 62 games in a tenure that has yielded 31 wins, 14 draws and 17 defeats.\n\nDinamo Zagreb’s Dominik Livakovic looks set to get the nod between the sticks after fending off competition from Ivo Grbic and Ivica Ivusic, a battle he has won, in part, thanks to the regular game time he enjoys at club level. In contrast, Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Grbic, who checked back in at the Wanda Metropolitan this season after spending last year at Lille, is struggling for minutes and that lack of regular action could ultimately prove to be his downfall.\n\nAs for the defence, the seasoned Lovren is the most experienced member of the rearguard and based on his pedigree and recent performances for Zenit, he is likely to be tasked with marshalling the backline. Another defender who Dalic has turned to in recent times is Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol, one of the national team’s rising stars, and Bayern Munich right-back Josip Stanisic.\n\nThe middle third unquestionably offers the biggest embarrassment of riches at Dalic’s disposal. The coach is able to call on the services of the aforementioned Modric and Brozovic, as well as the massively talented Mateo Kovacic and Mario Pasalic. Dalic will be aiming to get the most out of the considerable experience and quality offered by his midfield men in his quest to lead Croatia to glory in Qatar.\n\nIn the final third, we find Ivan Perisic, who we have opted to include amongst the forwards based on the fact that he operates in an attack-minded left-wing role for the national team. The Tottenham Hotspur ace is sure to be one of the Balkans’ most instrumental performers on Arab soil, but this is another department in which Dalic is certainly not bereft of options, with Ante Rebic, Andrej Kramaric, Lovro Majer and Nikola Vlasic among those ready to fire Croatia to success.', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'internalTitle': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'title': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'url': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'sys': {'id': '2bIegFPigLYdndoSQPjTw3', 'createdAt': '2022-10-17T18:40:06.186Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-10-17T18:40:06.186Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'socialMediaPost'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Key man: Luka Modric', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\r', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Although Croatia are often referred to as a solid unit blessed with immense quality, and despite the fact that it has been stated on countless occasions in the past, we will never tire of insisting that there is one member of the national team who is simply head and shoulders above the rest: the one and only Luka Modric.\n\nThe pass master’s massively impressive trophy haul with Real Madrid speaks volumes of his quality, while he further enhanced his status by landing the adidas Golden Ball at Russia 2018 – an award he was quick to dedicate to his compatriots: “I’m proud and this is a really special night for me. It’s one of the greatest moments of my career. Earning recognition from others is priceless to me, particularly when it comes from those closest to me and who love me. This award also belongs to the people of Croatia, who got behind us right from the very start of the World Cup in Russia.”\n\nModric’s pathway in the game is rather unique and was influenced by the historic events in Eastern Europe when he was taking his first steps in the sport. However, adversity brought the best out of Modric and forged the admirable values that have made him into the outstanding player and person he is, both on and off the field.

In the 2019 Afcon final against Algeria, Senegal lost to a goal that still defies explanation when Gomis was lobbed by an innocuous shot that appeared to touch the wire of the spidercam en route to the net.

Welsh football fan must have wondered if their team was hexed in major qualification campaigns. Under the charge of Chris Coleman and now Robert Page, however, fear and pessimism have given way to confidence and optimism.\n\nEmboldened by their participation in successive UEFA EUROs, Page’s team performed admirably from gun to tape in qualification for Qatar 2022, ending their 64-year FIFA World Cup™ exile with a nerveless 1-0 play-off win over Ukraine in Cardiff.\n\nAnd with that Gareth Bale-inspired victory, the demons of Scotland in 1977 and 1985, Gheorghe Hagi in 1993 and the nadir of Novi Sad a decade ago were banished.\n\nWales were in a promising position in their attempt to qualify for Argentina 1978 when the national FA chose to stage a high-stakes match with Scotland at Anfield in pursuit of increased gate receipts.\n\nThe Scots, roared on by an enormous Tartan Army presence, were awarded a generous late penalty and ultimately won 2-0 to extinguish Welsh hopes.\n\nWales appeared set to avenge that defeat eight years later when they led Scotland 1-0 at Cardiff City’s Ninian Park. Another marginal penalty call undid manager Mike England’s team, however, and Davie Cooper’s strike for the visitors saw Wales slip from top spot in their group and automatic qualification to a berth outside the play-offs.\n\nThere was another hard-luck story when only a home victory over Romania stood in the way of Wales and a place at USA 1994.\n\nWales were undefeated in 10 home matches and boss Terry Yorath could select a handful of world-class performers in Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs and Ian Rush.\n\nA rare Southall slip allowed a Hagi pot-shot to squirm into the net. But Wales equalised through Dean Saunders and were poised to complete the turnaround when Gary Speed was fouled in the box.\n\nLeft-back Paul Bodin had scored his three previous penalties for Wales but smacked this effort against the bar. Romania duly retook the lead and the Welsh World Cup wait continued.\n\nSubsequent campaigns featured any number of lows, the nadir a 6-1 thumping by Serbia in Novi Sad at the outset of qualifying for Brazil 2014, shortly after Coleman replaced the late Speed as boss.\n\nColeman steadily repaired confidence, harnessing the creative talents of Bale and Aaron Ramsey to oversee progression to the EURO 2016 semi-finals. Still, World Cup qualification remained elusive, Wales stunned 1-0 at home by Republic of Ireland to miss out on a shot at the play-offs for Russia 2018.\n\nBut there would be no stopping Page’s redoubtable team four years later. Wales took points from Belgium and Czech Republic to secure a play-off berth.

Dalic’s charges will also come up against Canada and Morocco, two tough sides who will certainly not make life easy for the Balkan outfit.', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'sections': [], 'contentTypesCheckboxValue': 'Video', 'internalTitle': 'Video > Croatia v England | Semi-finals | 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ | Extended Highlights', 'title': 'Croatia v England | Semi-finals | 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ | Extended Highlights', 'slugV2': 'croatia-v-england-semi-finals-2018-fifa-world-cup-extended-highlights', 'description': 'Watch the extended highlights from the match between Croatia and England played at Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow on Wednesday, 11 July 2018.', 'dateOfReleaseV2': '2018-07-11T00:00:00', 'semanticTags': ['2Gz195Pyz6ljCjBFPPFxht', '7xUlday10PuZVujCcR8iq0', '0x5722578825e577469ec2ec5ed7d592b5', '0x328bf3f28335ab49b08ac829dafa3d12', 'amt4KXUpN75BNvpc0MSKW', '0x117592f1e53eba49ac4c89f6a10f6f6e', '0xfdc0dac12a72ab4b8a22ccddbad12bad', '2a9aS495143EmGghBkztq0', '0x757658c0db60f34a844557a08e92636a', '2X4DCVdND68kLsAaQxX7FT', '0xdfeb6b09584a6344a3ff76c43c22717e'], 'semanticTagReferences': [], 'sys': {'id': 'vu30H5OR9XiSx6AUIu6Rs', 'createdAt': '2022-01-21T12:38:35.734Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-06-06T14:18:04.112Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'video'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia’s Group F fixtures', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Morocco-Croatia', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n23 November, 11:00 (local time)\r\n\n', 'marks': []}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia-Canada', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n27 November, 17:00 (local time)\r\n\n', 'marks': []}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Croatia-Belgium', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\n1 December, 16:00 (local time)', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'sections': [], 'contentTypesCheckboxValue': 'Video', 'internalTitle': 'Video > Netherlands v Croatia | Play-off for third place | 1998 FIFA World Cup France™ | Highlights', 'title': 'Netherlands v Croatia | Play-off for third place | 1998 FIFA World Cup France™ | Highlights', 'slugV2': 'netherlands-v-croatia-third-place-match-i-1998-fifa-world-cup-france-highlights', 'description': 'Watch the highlights from the match between Netherlands and Croatia played at Parc des Princes, Paris on Saturday, 11 July 1998.', 'dateOfReleaseV2': '1998-07-11T00:00:00', 'semanticTags': ['2orV3zAQ77fSKVBfqefsDA', '3IFBxv7yOP13m8kLkBAWvE', 'PgRaCY1Y0gLgJEJH6sAYH', '0x3690f1d362555543bfa526aebc3be496', '0x5722578825e577469ec2ec5ed7d592b5', '0x328bf3f28335ab49b08ac829dafa3d12', 'amt4KXUpN75BNvpc0MSKW', '0xd2336894ab243d498aed7b6ddbcc67e1', '0xed2af797aab21e42bc9fb51ff11077a7', '0x705ae90667575b47a70596d95526eb3f', '2X4DCVdND68kLsAaQxX7FT'], 'semanticTagReferences': [], 'sys': {'id': '5EEPlWk5SSwmS2YMGn3GwI', 'createdAt': '2022-01-21T12:34:08.651Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-08-31T14:42:05.966Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'video'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Dalic’s approach and tactics', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'If there is one thing you are guaranteed from Dalic’s team, besides the consistent excellence of the majestic Modric, it is the 4-3-3 formation that has brought such fine results in recent years. The coach’s trusted blueprint has worked a treat and he is sure to retain faith in a system that results in a very attack-minded style of play in which the team look to play in the opposition’s half. Since his appointment as national-team coach, the Livno-born tactician has overseen 62 games in a tenure that has yielded 31 wins, 14 draws and 17 defeats.\n\nDinamo Zagreb’s Dominik Livakovic looks set to get the nod between the sticks after fending off competition from Ivo Grbic and Ivica Ivusic, a battle he has won, in part, thanks to the regular game time he enjoys at club level. In contrast, Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Grbic, who checked back in at the Wanda Metropolitan this season after spending last year at Lille, is struggling for minutes and that lack of regular action could ultimately prove to be his downfall.\n\nAs for the defence, the seasoned Lovren is the most experienced member of the rearguard and based on his pedigree and recent performances for Zenit, he is likely to be tasked with marshalling the backline. Another defender who Dalic has turned to in recent times is Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol, one of the national team’s rising stars, and Bayern Munich right-back Josip Stanisic.\n\nThe middle third unquestionably offers the biggest embarrassment of riches at Dalic’s disposal. The coach is able to call on the services of the aforementioned Modric and Brozovic, as well as the massively talented Mateo Kovacic and Mario Pasalic. Dalic will be aiming to get the most out of the considerable experience and quality offered by his midfield men in his quest to lead Croatia to glory in Qatar.\n\nIn the final third, we find Ivan Perisic, who we have opted to include amongst the forwards based on the fact that he operates in an attack-minded left-wing role for the national team. The Tottenham Hotspur ace is sure to be one of the Balkans’ most instrumental performers on Arab soil, but this is another department in which Dalic is certainly not bereft of options, with Ante Rebic, Andrej Kramaric, Lovro Majer and Nikola Vlasic among those ready to fire Croatia to success.', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'embedded-entry-block', 'content': [], 'data': {'target': {'internalTitle': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'title': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'url': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ2cOvKgvO/?hl=en', 'sys': {'id': '2bIegFPigLYdndoSQPjTw3', 'createdAt': '2022-10-17T18:40:06.186Z', 'updatedAt': '2022-10-17T18:40:06.186Z', 'locale': 'en', 'contentType': {'systemProperties': {'id': 'socialMediaPost'}}}}}}, {'nodeType': 'heading-3', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Key man: Luka Modric', 'marks': [{'type': 'bold'}]}, {'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': '\r', 'marks': []}]}, {'nodeType': 'paragraph', 'data': {}, 'content': [{'nodeType': 'text', 'data': {}, 'value': 'Although Croatia are often referred to as a solid unit blessed with immense quality, and despite the fact that it has been stated on countless occasions in the past, we will never tire of insisting that there is one member of the national team who is simply head and shoulders above the rest: the one and only Luka Modric.\n\nThe pass master’s massively impressive trophy haul with Real Madrid speaks volumes of his quality, while he further enhanced his status by landing the adidas Golden Ball at Russia 2018 – an award he was quick to dedicate to his compatriots: “I’m proud and this is a really special night for me. It’s one of the greatest moments of my career. Earning recognition from others is priceless to me, particularly when it comes from those closest to me and who love me. This award also belongs to the people of Croatia, who got behind us right from the very start of the World Cup in Russia.”\n\nModric’s pathway in the game is rather unique and was influenced by the historic events in Eastern Europe when he was taking his first steps in the sport. However, adversity brought the best out of Modric and forged the admirable values that have made him into the outstanding player and person he is, both on and off the field.

In the 2019 Afcon final against Algeria, Senegal lost to a goal that still defies explanation when Gomis was lobbed by an innocuous shot that appeared to touch the wire of the spidercam en route to the net.

Welsh football fan must have wondered if their team was hexed in major qualification campaigns. Under the charge of Chris Coleman and now Robert Page, however, fear and pessimism have given way to confidence and optimism.\n\nEmboldened by their participation in successive UEFA EUROs, Page’s team performed admirably from gun to tape in qualification for Qatar 2022, ending their 64-year FIFA World Cup™ exile with a nerveless 1-0 play-off win over Ukraine in Cardiff.\n\nAnd with that Gareth Bale-inspired victory, the demons of Scotland in 1977 and 1985, Gheorghe Hagi in 1993 and the nadir of Novi Sad a decade ago were banished.\n\nWales were in a promising position in their attempt to qualify for Argentina 1978 when the national FA chose to stage a high-stakes match with Scotland at Anfield in pursuit of increased gate receipts.\n\nThe Scots, roared on by an enormous Tartan Army presence, were awarded a generous late penalty and ultimately won 2-0 to extinguish Welsh hopes.\n\nWales appeared set to avenge that defeat eight years later when they led Scotland 1-0 at Cardiff City’s Ninian Park. Another marginal penalty call undid manager Mike England’s team, however, and Davie Cooper’s strike for the visitors saw Wales slip from top spot in their group and automatic qualification to a berth outside the play-offs.\n\nThere was another hard-luck story when only a home victory over Romania stood in the way of Wales and a place at USA 1994.\n\nWales were undefeated in 10 home matches and boss Terry Yorath could select a handful of world-class performers in Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs and Ian Rush.\n\nA rare Southall slip allowed a Hagi pot-shot to squirm into the net. But Wales equalised through Dean Saunders and were poised to complete the turnaround when Gary Speed was fouled in the box.\n\nLeft-back Paul Bodin had scored his three previous penalties for Wales but smacked this effort against the bar. Romania duly retook the lead and the Welsh World Cup wait continued.\n\nSubsequent campaigns featured any number of lows, the nadir a 6-1 thumping by Serbia in Novi Sad at the outset of qualifying for Brazil 2014, shortly after Coleman replaced the late Speed as boss.\n\nColeman steadily repaired confidence, harnessing the creative talents of Bale and Aaron Ramsey to oversee progression to the EURO 2016 semi-finals. Still, World Cup qualification remained elusive, Wales stunned 1-0 at home by Republic of Ireland to miss out on a shot at the play-offs for Russia 2018.\n\nBut there would be no stopping Page’s redoubtable team four years later. Wales took points from Belgium and Czech Republic to secure a play-off berth.
