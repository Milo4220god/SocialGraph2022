Football cleaning - explains how we got all the fifa2023 values and calculated the missing values for the players that had no overall score 
e.i. the Qater team had no score and was not part of the datasets and we had to create a function added the players and the value . 

Explainer_notebook - is where we use the datasets, data clean, create networks, sentiment analysis and data description etc.

new_clean_test - is where we gather all the data for clubs, players and leagues. 

Archieve.ZIp is a file with all our text files 

All_list_dataset is a file with all our csv files and the data we have gathered into CSV.
